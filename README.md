Data Cleaning â€“ Item Fat Content Standardization
Why?
Cleaning the Item_Fat_Content field ensures data consistency. Variations like LF, low fat, and Low Fat can cause incorrect aggregations. By standardizing, we ensure more accurate reporting.

Query -
UPDATE blinkit_data
SET Item_Fat_Content = 
    CASE 
        WHEN Item_Fat_Content IN ('LF', 'low fat') THEN 'Low Fat'
        WHEN Item_Fat_Content = 'reg' THEN 'Regular'
        ELSE Item_Fat_Content
    END;

Whitespace Removal from Standardized Fields
Why?
After cleaning, we found some extra spaces in â€˜Regularâ€™ causing duplicates in reporting.

Query - 
UPDATE blinkit_data
SET Item_Fat_Content = TRIM(Item_Fat_Content);
